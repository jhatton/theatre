		<h3>CHARACTERS</h3>
		<p>Jimmy Harper - A wholesome, innocent, high school teenager who runs into trouble after he is lured into the dangerous world of reefer</p>
		<p>Lecturer - a severe authority figure who warns the audience of the perils of Reefer Madness. (Doubles as Goat-Man, Mr. Poppy, Irish Priest, Old Man, 
		Radio Announcer, Ticket-Taker, Policeman, FDR)</p>
		<p>Mary Lane - Jimmy's sweetheart, a naïve, virginal teenage girl.</p>
		<p>Jack Stone - The handsome and ruthless proprietor of the Reefer Den, a 30's gangster movie-type. (Doubles as Jesus, George Washington)</p>
		<p>Mae - An attractive, yet slightly haggard dame in her mid-30s, the hostess of the Reefer Den.</p>
		<p>Ralph Wiley - a denizen of the Reefer Den, formally a fraternity man, his college days ended long ago due to his reefer habit. 
		(Doubles as Sally's Baby, Switch-Puller, Uncle Sam)</p>
		<p>Sally - a sexy and seductive resident of the Reefer Den, she possesses the libidinous soul of Mae West combined with the rat-a-tat moxie of vintage 
		Barbara Stanwyck. (Doubles as Lady Liberty)</p>
		<p>Placard Girl - throughout the play she reinforces the warnings of the Lecturer by holding large signs that clearly state the moral of what we've just seen. 
		(Doubles as Five-and-Dime Kid, Police Officer)</p>
		<p>Ensemble - Mixed gender group to represent Reefer Zombies, Kids at the Five-and-Dime, Jungle Orgy dancers, Angels, and patriotic background chorus in 
		the Star-Spangled finale.</p>
		<h4>About the Show</h4> 
		<p>Inspired by the original 1936 film of the same name, this raucous musical comedy takes a tongue-in-cheek look at the hysteria caused 
		when clean-cut kids fall prey to marijuana, leading them on a hysterical downward spiral filled with evil jazz music, sex and violence. You won't be 
		able to resist the spoofy fun of REEFER MADNESS. The addictive and clever musical numbers range from big Broadway-style showstoppers to swing tunes like 
		'Down at the Ol' Five and Dime' and the Vegas-style 'Listen to Jesus, Jimmy,' featuring J.C.
		Himself leading a chorus of showgirl angels. This dynamic show will go straight to your head! REEFER MADNESS is a highly stylized and satirical
		political commentary. It contains adult humor, religious parody, and drug use, as well as suggested violence and sexual explicitness. It therefore 
 		may be inappropriate for younger performers and audiences.</p>
